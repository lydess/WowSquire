A notepad for ideas aswell as footnotes

MVP notes
- a window which displays information relevent to the NPC that is currently targeted
- a hide button for the window to hide it from view
- a show button that is anchored to the players target frame which shows only when an NPC has data about it


Known issues
1. the eyebutton shows up on inital login, i cant set it as initialy hidden becuase the stupid API will try to index it and find a nil value, ill need to find some frame that can be shown at launch, attaach some logic to it and then set it as hidden


Footnotes
1. Wows events API only has an endpoint for "Changing targets" which fires when you de-target somthing, meaning its imposible to determine without checking that the player indeed has a target, so for the time being this nested if is kinda the only way i can think of without needlless complexity
