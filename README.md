Wowsquire is an addon for the MMO world of warcraft, its goal is to help new players understand the absoulutly twisted and convoluted lore of the game by providing a contextual pop up whenever they target an NPC of lore significance, and then provide them with
A plain english explanation of who they are and some important words that the player will usualy hear when they're adventuring with that NPC



Example: a player meets this big green orc named thrall and notices the (not final) button pop up on his name plate
